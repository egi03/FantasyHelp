## üß† **Data Science & Machine Learning Strategy**

### **Key Predictions & Models**

#### **1. Player Performance Prediction**
- **Goal**: Predict next gameweek points for each player
- **Features**:
  - Recent form (last 5-10 games)
  - Opposition strength
  - Home/away advantage
  - Injury status
  - Historical performance vs specific teams
- **Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Output**: Expected points with confidence intervals

#### **2. Transfer Recommendation Engine**
- **Goal**: Suggest optimal transfers based on budget and team needs
- **Approach**:
  - Multi-objective optimization (maximize points, minimize cost)
  - Consider transfer costs and deadlines
  - Factor in upcoming fixtures (3-5 gameweeks ahead)
- **Algorithm**: Genetic algorithms or linear programming

#### **3. Price Change Prediction**
- **Goal**: Predict when player prices will rise/fall
- **Features**:
  - Transfer trends (net transfers in/out)
  - Performance metrics
  - Media mentions/hype
- **Model**: Classification model (price up/down/stable)

#### **4. Captain Choice Optimization**
- **Goal**: Recommend best captain for each gameweek
- **Approach**:
  - Combine performance prediction with uncertainty
  - Consider ceiling (potential for high scores)
  - Factor in ownership percentage for differential strategy

#### **5. Season-Long Strategy**
- **Goal**: Long-term team planning
- **Features**:
  - Fixture congestion analysis
  - Team rotation patterns
  - European competition impact
- **Output**: Wildcard timing, long-term transfer plans

### **Advanced Analytics Features**

#### **1. Fixture Difficulty Engine**
- Create dynamic difficulty ratings based on:
  - Defensive/offensive team strength
  - Recent form
  - Home/away factors
  - Missing key players

#### **2. Value Detection System**
- Identify undervalued players using:
  - Expected vs actual points
  - Ownership percentage analysis
  - Upcoming fixture analysis
  - Price trend analysis

#### **3. Risk Assessment**
- **Injury Prediction**: ML model based on playing time, age, position
- **Rotation Risk**: Predict likelihood of being benched
- **Suspension Risk**: Track yellow cards and disciplinary records
